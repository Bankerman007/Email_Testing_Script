# Email_Testing_Script
This script can be used to test several common email formats to determine which is valid.  
I've used this when I know the company domain (can usually easily obtain this from their website) and the individuals name at the organization.
This tool will ping the email server to test if the email is valid.  It will test several variations of the email address to help find the valid form.
